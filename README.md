# ASP.NET Core Docker SSL/TLS Reference Implementation

A comprehensive reference implementation demonstrating SSL/TLS certificate configuration for ASP.NET Core applications running in Docker containers on Linux, with cross-platform certificate management using PowerShell Core and .NET X509Store API.

**Project Focus:** Docker SSL/TLS configuration, not invoice management (the API is just a demo application)

## Overview

This project demonstrates best practices for:
- Self-signed certificate generation for development environments
- X509Store certificate management on Linux and WSL
- Cross-platform certificate deployment (WSL, Linux, Docker)
- Kestrel HTTPS configuration with custom certificates
- Automated certificate installation with PowerShell Core
- Non-root Docker container certificate handling
- Red Hat Universal Base Image (UBI) deployment for enterprise compliance

The project includes a minimal REST API (invoice management) to demonstrate the certificate configuration in a real-world application context.

## Why Red Hat UBI?

This project uses **Red Hat Universal Base Images (UBI)** instead of Microsoft's official .NET container images due to corporate requirements for enterprise support and compliance.

**Key Benefits:**
- Enterprise support and long-term maintenance from Red Hat
- Security-focused updates through Red Hat's RHEL repositories
- Compliance with corporate container image policies
- Production-ready for regulated environments

**Custom Base Images:**
This project builds two custom base images from Red Hat UBI8:
- `artemis/ubi8-dotnet-sdk:9.0` - Build environment with .NET 9.0 SDK (~680MB)
- `artemis/ubi8-aspnet-runtime:9.0` - Runtime with ASP.NET Core 9.0 and PowerShell Core 7+ (~440MB)

Both images include .NET 9.0 and PowerShell Core 7+ from Microsoft's official RHEL repositories, ensuring feature parity with Microsoft images.

**Image Size Tradeoff:**
The UBI8-minimal base (~96MB) is smaller than Microsoft's aspnet base (~220MB), but the final artemis runtime image is ~440MB due to PowerShell Core 7+ requirement for cross-platform certificate automation. This is approximately double Microsoft's .NET image size (~220MB), but necessary for automated X509Store certificate management in containers.

## ðŸš€ Quick Start (5 Minutes)

Get up and running in 5 simple steps:

### 1. Build Base Images (One-time setup)
```bash
pwsh ./build-base-images.ps1
```

### 2. Generate Certificates
```bash
pwsh ./Setup-Certificates.ps1
```

### 3. Start Application
```bash
pwsh ./Start-DockerCompose.ps1
```

### 4. Verify Deployment
```bash
# Check container status
docker-compose ps

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f artemis-api

# Test HTTP endpoint
curl http://localhost:5000/api/invoices

# Test HTTPS endpoint
curl -k https://localhost:5001/api/invoices

# Verify certificates installed
docker exec artemis-invoicing-api pwsh -Command \
  '$store = [System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates.X509Store]::new("My", "CurrentUser"); \
   $store.Open("ReadOnly"); \
   Write-Host "Certificates: $($store.Certificates.Count)"; \
   $store.Close()'
```

### 5. Stop Application
```bash
docker-compose down
```

**That's it!** Your ASP.NET Core API is now running with SSL/TLS certificates in Docker. ðŸŽ‰

For detailed explanations and troubleshooting, see the sections below.

## Why This Project?

Configuring SSL/TLS certificates for ASP.NET Core in Docker on Linux is **non-trivial**:

- Windows Certificate Store doesn't exist on Linux
- .NET uses a different certificate store structure on Linux (`~/.dotnet/corefx/cryptography/x509stores/`)
- Simply copying certificate files is insufficient - certificates must be registered via X509Store API
- Docker containers require special handling for certificate mounting and installation
- Cross-platform certificate management requires PowerShell Core (pwsh)
- Certificate chain validation works differently on Linux vs Windows

This project solves these challenges with a complete, working implementation that you can use as a reference for your own projects.

## Detailed Setup Guide

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose
- PowerShell Core (pwsh) 7.0 or later
- .NET 9.0 SDK (for local development)
- Linux, WSL, or macOS (Windows support limited to local development)
- Access to Red Hat UBI registry (registry.access.redhat.com - publicly available)

### 1. Generate Certificates

Run the certificate setup script:

```bash
pwsh ./Setup-Certificates.ps1
```

This creates certificates in `~/certs/` and installs them to X509Store.

### 2. Build UBI Base Images (One-time)

Build the custom Red Hat UBI base images:

```bash
pwsh ./build-base-images.ps1
```

### 3. Run with Docker Compose

Start the application:

```bash
pwsh ./Start-DockerCompose.ps1
```

The application will be available at:
- **HTTPS**: `https://localhost:5001`
- **HTTP**: `http://localhost:5000`
- **Swagger UI**: `https://localhost:5001/`

### 4. Verify Certificate Configuration

Test that the custom certificate is working:

```bash
# Verify HTTPS connection
curl -k https://localhost:5001/api/invoices

# Run certificate validation tests
pwsh ./Test-CertificateSetup.ps1

# List certificates in container
docker exec artemis-api pwsh -Command "Get-ChildItem Cert:\\CurrentUser\\My"
```

## PowerShell Scripts (Cross-Platform)

All automation scripts use **PowerShell Core (pwsh)** for cross-platform compatibility:

### Start-DockerCompose.ps1
Wrapper script for Docker Compose with automatic certificate management:
```powershell
# Start containers (reads certificate files automatically)
pwsh ./Start-DockerCompose.ps1

# Build images
pwsh ./Start-DockerCompose.ps1 -Command build

# View logs
pwsh ./Start-DockerCompose.ps1 -Command logs

# Stop containers
pwsh ./Start-DockerCompose.ps1 -Command down
```

### docker-entrypoint.ps1
Container startup script that:
- Validates PowerShell availability
- Runs Install-DockerCertificates.ps1
- Starts the .NET application

**Platform Support:**
- âœ… Windows (PowerShell 7+)
- âœ… Linux (PowerShell 7+)
- âœ… macOS (PowerShell 7+)
- âœ… Docker (Red Hat UBI with PowerShell)

## Certificate Architecture on Linux

### .NET Certificate Store Structure

On Linux, .NET Core uses a file-based certificate store located at:

```
$HOME/.dotnet/corefx/cryptography/x509stores/
â”œâ”€â”€ root/          # Trusted Root CA certificates
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ <hash>.pfx
â”œâ”€â”€ my/            # Personal certificates (with private keys)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ <thumbprint>.pfx
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ <thumbprint>.crt
â””â”€â”€ ca/            # Intermediate CA certificates
```

For the Docker container (running as `artemis` user):
- Store path: `/home/artemis/.dotnet/corefx/cryptography/x509stores/`

For WSL/Linux development:
- Store path: `~/.dotnet/corefx/cryptography/x509stores/`

### Why X509Store API is Required

Simply copying certificate files to these directories is **insufficient**. Certificates must be:

1. **Loaded into memory** as X509Certificate2 objects with proper flags
2. **Added to the appropriate X509Store** via the .NET API
3. **Properly indexed** by thumbprint and hash
4. **Validated and trusted** by the certificate chain

The PowerShell scripts in this project use the X509Store API to ensure certificates are correctly installed:

```powershell
# Install certificate to CurrentUser\My store
$store = New-Object System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates.X509Store(
    [System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates.StoreName]::My,
    [System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates.StoreLocation]::CurrentUser
)
$store.Open([System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates.OpenFlags]::ReadWrite)
$store.Add($cert)
$store.Close()
```

### Certificate Chain

```
[Artemis Root CA]  (CurrentUser\Root)
        â†“
[artemis-api.local]  (CurrentUser\My)
```

The application loads the server certificate from `CurrentUser\My`, and the .NET framework validates it against the CA certificate in `CurrentUser\Root`.

### Docker Considerations

Docker containers require special handling:

1. **Certificate files mounted as volumes**
   - Source: `~/projs/dotnet/artemis.svc/certs/`
   - Target: `/certs/` (inside container)

2. **Installation script run during container startup**
   - `docker-entrypoint.ps1` executed as ENTRYPOINT
   - Calls `Install-DockerCertificates.ps1` for certificate installation
   - Installs CA to Root store
   - Installs server certificate to My store
   - Starts the .NET application

3. **Proper file permissions**
   - PFX files: 600 (read/write for owner only)
   - CRT files: 644 (read for all)
   - Owner: `artemis` user (non-root)

4. **Non-root user access**
   - Container runs as `artemis` user (UID 1000)
   - Certificate store: `/home/artemis/.dotnet/corefx/cryptography/x509stores/`
   - PowerShell scripts run as `artemis` user

## Docker Deployment Guide

This project uses **runtime certificate installation** with Red Hat UBI for secure, flexible deployments.

**Key Advantages:**
- Certificates not baked into image
- Easy certificate rotation without rebuild
- Same image works across environments
- Enterprise-grade UBI base with RHEL security updates

### Step-by-Step Deployment

#### 1. Generate Certificates

Run the setup script to create certificates:

```bash
pwsh ./Setup-Certificates.ps1
```

This creates certificates in `~/certs/` and updates `appsettings.json` with the thumbprint.

#### 2. Build UBI Base Images (One-time)

```bash
pwsh ./build-base-images.ps1
```

#### 3. Build Application Image

```bash
docker build -t artemis-api:latest .
```

#### 4. Run Container

```bash
pwsh ./Start-DockerCompose.ps1
```

#### 5. Verify Deployment

```bash
# Check logs
docker logs artemis-api

# Test HTTPS
curl -k https://localhost:5001/api/invoices
```

### Docker Compose Configuration

The `docker-compose.yml` demonstrates volume mounting for certificates:

```yaml
services:
  artemis-api:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "5000:5000"
      - "5001:5001"
    volumes:
      - ./certs:/certs:ro  # Mount certificates read-only
    environment:
      - ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=Development
      - ASPNETCORE_URLS=https://+:5001;http://+:5000
```

**Volume mount details:**
- **Source**: `./certs` (relative to docker-compose.yml)
- **Target**: `/certs` (inside container)
- **Mode**: `ro` (read-only for security)

### Dockerfile Architecture

Multi-stage build using Red Hat UBI custom base images:

```dockerfile
# Stage 1: Build
FROM artemis/ubi8-dotnet-sdk:9.0 AS build
WORKDIR /src
COPY ["artemis.svc.csproj", "./"]
RUN dotnet restore
COPY . .
RUN dotnet build -c Release -o /app/build

# Stage 2: Publish
FROM build AS publish
RUN dotnet publish -c Release -o /app/publish

# Stage 3: Runtime
FROM artemis/ubi8-aspnet-runtime:9.0 AS final
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=publish --chown=artemis:artemis /app/publish .
COPY --chown=artemis:artemis Install-DockerCertificates.ps1 /app/
COPY --chown=artemis:artemis docker-entrypoint.ps1 /app/
USER artemis
EXPOSE 5000 5001
ENTRYPOINT ["pwsh", "-File", "/app/docker-entrypoint.ps1"]
```

**Key Features:**
- Red Hat UBI8 base images (enterprise compliance)
- .NET 9.0 from Microsoft RHEL repositories
- PowerShell Core 7+ for certificate automation
- Non-root user (artemis, UID 1000)
- Runtime certificate installation via entrypoint

### Certificate Rotation

To rotate certificates:

1. Generate new certificates: `pwsh ./Setup-Certificates.ps1`
2. Restart container: `docker-compose restart`

The container picks up new certificates from the mounted volume on startup.

## PowerShell Scripts

### Setup-Certificates.ps1
Generates self-signed CA and server certificates, installs them to X509Store, and updates `appsettings.json`.

```bash
pwsh ./Setup-Certificates.ps1
```

### Install-DockerCertificates.ps1
Installs certificates inside Docker containers at runtime (called automatically by entrypoint).

```bash
docker exec artemis-api pwsh ./Install-DockerCertificates.ps1
```

### Test-CertificateSetup.ps1
Verifies certificate installation and chain validation.

```bash
pwsh ./Test-CertificateSetup.ps1
```

## Demo Application: Invoice API

The project includes a minimal REST API for invoice management to demonstrate the certificate configuration in a real-world application context.

### Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| GET | `/api/invoices` | List all invoices |
| GET | `/api/invoices/{id}` | Get invoice by ID |
| POST | `/api/invoices` | Create new invoice |
| PUT | `/api/invoices/{id}` | Update invoice |
| DELETE | `/api/invoices/{id}` | Delete invoice |

### Invoice Model

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "invoiceNumber": "INV-2025-001",
  "date": "2025-10-03T10:30:00Z",
  "customerName": "Acme Corporation",
  "amount": 1500.00,
  "status": 1
}
```

**Invoice Status Values:**
- `0` - Draft
- `1` - Sent
- `2` - Paid
- `3` - Overdue
- `4` - Cancelled

### Testing the API

```bash
# Verify HTTPS is working with custom certificate
curl -k https://localhost:5001/api/invoices

# Access Swagger UI
open https://localhost:5001

# Create a test invoice
curl -k -X POST https://localhost:5001/api/invoices \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "invoiceNumber": "INV-2025-999",
    "date": "2025-10-04T00:00:00Z",
    "customerName": "Test Customer",
    "amount": 1000.00,
    "status": 0
  }'
```

**Note:** The invoice API uses in-memory storage and is for demonstration purposes only. Data is lost when the container restarts.

## Technology Stack

- **.NET 9.0**: ASP.NET Core Web API
- **Kestrel**: High-performance web server with custom certificate support
- **X509Store API**: Cross-platform certificate management
- **PowerShell Core (pwsh)**: Certificate automation scripts
- **Red Hat UBI 8**: Enterprise-grade base images (UBI8 and UBI8-minimal)
- **Docker**: Container runtime for Linux deployment
- **OpenSSL**: Certificate generation (via PowerShell)
- **Swagger/OpenAPI**: API documentation

## Configuration

### appsettings.json

The application loads certificates based on thumbprint configuration:

```json
{
  "Kestrel": {
    "Endpoints": {
      "Https": {
        "Url": "https://0.0.0.0:5001"
      },
      "Http": {
        "Url": "http://0.0.0.0:5000"
      }
    }
  },
  "CertificateSettings": {
    "Thumbprint": "A1B2C3D4E5F6G7H8I9J0K1L2M3N4O5P6Q7R8S9T0",
    "StoreName": "My",
    "StoreLocation": "CurrentUser"
  }
}
```

**Configuration options:**
- `Thumbprint`: Certificate thumbprint (no spaces or colons)
- `StoreName`: Certificate store name (`My`, `Root`, `CA`)
- `StoreLocation`: Store location (`CurrentUser`, `LocalMachine`)

### Program.cs Certificate Loading

The application loads certificates using the X509Store API:

```csharp
using (var store = new X509Store(StoreName.My, StoreLocation.CurrentUser))
{
    store.Open(OpenFlags.ReadOnly);
    var certs = store.Certificates.Find(
        X509FindType.FindByThumbprint,
        thumbprint,
        validOnly: false
    );

    if (certs.Count > 0)
    {
        options.ServerCertificate = certs[0];
    }
}
```

### Environment Variables

Override configuration using environment variables:

```bash
# Override certificate thumbprint
export CertificateSettings__Thumbprint="YOUR_THUMBPRINT_HERE"

# Override Kestrel endpoints
export Kestrel__Endpoints__Https__Url="https://0.0.0.0:5001"

# Set ASP.NET Core environment
export ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=Production
```

## Troubleshooting

### Certificate Not Trusted

**Issue:** Certificate chain validation fails

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check logs and verify installation
docker logs artemis-api
docker exec artemis-api pwsh ./Test-CertificateSetup.ps1
```

### Application Won't Start

**Issue:** Container exits immediately

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check logs and certificate thumbprint
docker logs artemis-api
docker exec artemis-api cat appsettings.json
```

### UBI Base Images Not Found

**Issue:** "pull access denied for artemis/ubi8-dotnet-sdk"

**Solution:**
```bash
# Build base images first
pwsh ./build-base-images.ps1
docker images | grep artemis/ubi8
```

### Certificate Files Not Found

**Issue:** "Cannot find path '/certs/artemis-api.pfx'"

**Solution:**
```bash
# Generate certificates and verify mount
pwsh ./Setup-Certificates.ps1
ls -la ~/certs/
docker exec artemis-api ls -la /certs/
```

### SSL Connection Fails

**Issue:** "certificate verify failed"

**Solution:**
```bash
# Use -k flag for self-signed certificates
curl -k https://localhost:5001/api/invoices

# Or install CA certificate in client's trusted store
```

## Security Considerations

1. **Certificate Storage**
   - Private keys stored in PFX files with proper permissions (600)
   - Certificate directory mounted read-only in Docker (`:ro`)
   - Certificates not embedded in Docker images

2. **Certificate Expiration**
   - Monitor certificate expiration dates
   - Setup: 2-year server certificate, 5-year CA certificate
   - Use `Test-CertificateSetup.ps1` to check expiration

3. **Private Key Protection**
   - PFX files contain private keys (keep secure)
   - Never commit PFX files to version control (add to `.gitignore`)
   - Use proper file permissions (600 on Linux)

4. **Container Security**
   - Container runs as non-root user (`artemis`, UID 1000)
   - Certificates installed to user store, not system store
   - Read-only volume mounts for certificates

5. **Development vs. Production**
   - This setup is for **development only**
   - Production should use certificates from trusted CA
   - Consider using Let's Encrypt or Azure Key Vault for production

6. **Input Validation**
   - API includes basic input validation
   - Error responses don't expose sensitive information
   - HTTPS redirection enabled in production

## Local Development (Without Docker)

You can also run the application locally for development:

### Prerequisites
- .NET 9.0 SDK
- PowerShell Core (pwsh)
- Linux, WSL, or macOS

### Steps

1. **Generate certificates:**
   ```bash
   pwsh ./Setup-Certificates.ps1
   ```

2. **Build the application:**
   ```bash
   dotnet build
   ```

3. **Run the application:**
   ```bash
   dotnet run
   ```

4. **Access the application:**
   - HTTPS: `https://localhost:5001`
   - HTTP: `http://localhost:5000`
   - Swagger: `https://localhost:5001/`

### Certificate Location (Local Development)

Certificates are installed to:
- `~/.dotnet/corefx/cryptography/x509stores/my/` (server certificate)
- `~/.dotnet/corefx/cryptography/x509stores/root/` (CA certificate)

## Production Deployment Considerations

This reference implementation focuses on **development environments**. For production:

### Use Trusted CA Certificates
- Obtain certificates from trusted CA (Let's Encrypt, DigiCert, etc.)
- Avoid self-signed certificates in production
- Ensure proper certificate chain validation

### Externalize Certificate Management
- Use Azure Key Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, or HashiCorp Vault
- Implement certificate rotation policies
- Monitor certificate expiration with alerting

### Kubernetes Deployment
- Use cert-manager for automated certificate management
- Store certificates in Kubernetes Secrets
- Use Ingress controllers for TLS termination

### Security Hardening
- Implement proper authentication and authorization
- Use HTTPS redirection (enabled by default)
- Enable HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security)
- Configure proper CORS policies
- Implement rate limiting and DDoS protection

### Monitoring and Logging
- Implement structured logging
- Monitor certificate expiration dates
- Track SSL/TLS handshake failures
- Set up health checks and readiness probes
